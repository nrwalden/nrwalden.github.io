Welcome to my engineering project portfolio. I am a Motorsports Engineering student focused on using simulation, data analysis, and mechanical design tools to solve performance-driven engineering problems.

This GitHub Pages site showcases my work across MATLAB, Simulink, Python, and 3D CAD, with applications in suspension modeling, aerodynamics, optimization, and racing data analysis.



⭐ Technical Skills

    MATLAB / Simulink – regression modeling, optimization, correlation analysis, quarter-car modeling
    
    Python – statistics, visualization, notebook-based analysis, automation
    
    CAD (SolidWorks, Fusion, NX) – reverse engineering, mechanical design, 3D prototyping
    
    Motorsports Engineering – suspension tuning, aero balance, lap-time modeling
    
    Manufacturing – CNC machining, composites, additive manufacturing

🔧 MATLAB & Simulink Highlights
Correlation & Regression (St. Pete Practice Analysis)

Analyzes track temperature, tire wear, and fuel load to build multivariable regression models predicting lap time.

Aerodynamic Optimization (GT Wing Placement)

Uses nonlinear constrained optimization (fmincon) to minimize lap time under cooling and downforce constraints.

Rear-Stagger Regression Modeling

Quadratic regression and R² analysis to determine optimal rear-stagger settings for qualifying.

Quarter-Car Suspension Control (Simulink)

Passive vs. semi-active suspension with PID damping control, including impulse and road-profile responses.

Suspension & Aerodynamics UDF Package

MATLAB user-defined functions for aero forces, ride frequency, and suspension travel modeling.
