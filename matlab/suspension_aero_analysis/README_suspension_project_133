## Performance Vehicle Suspension & Aerodynamic Analysis (ENGR 133 Individual Project)

This project simulates suspension and aerodynamic behavior for a performance vehicle using a set of
MATLAB user-defined functions (UDFs) and a demo script.

**Key pieces:**

- `ind_proj_demo.m` – main script that ties the analysis together
- `calcAerodynamics` – computes lift and drag over a range of speeds using air density, frontal area,
  lift/drag coefficients, and speed vector
- `calcRideFrequency` – calculates ride frequency from spring rate and sprung mass
- `calcSuspensionTravel` – estimates peak suspension travel in response to a bump input and damping ratio

The goal is to give a simple engineering tool that helps understand how tuning suspension and aerodynamic
parameters affects vehicle behavior.
