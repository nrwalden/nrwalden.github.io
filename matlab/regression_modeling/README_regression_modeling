# Quadratic Regression for Rear Stagger Optimization – Pavement Midget Racing

This project builds predictive single-variable quadratic models to determine the optimal rear-stagger setting (RS) for qualifying at Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park.

Rear stagger is defined as:
**RS = (CRR − CLR)**  
The goal is to model how RS affects lap time and identify the stagger that produces the fastest lap.

## 🎯 Objectives
### Part 1 — 3 Data Points
- Fit a quadratic model using a Vandermonde matrix  
- Predict lap times over 0–5 in of stagger  
- Identify the optimal stagger via vertex of the parabola  
- Plot the data, prediction curve, and optimal point  

### Part 2 — 7 Data Points
- Use the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse to solve for coefficients  
- Compute **R²** and **Adjusted R²**  
- Generate predictions + plot  
- Extract the optimal stagger from the updated model  

## 🛠️ MATLAB Techniques Demonstrated
- Matrix-based regression  
- Pseudoinverse using `pinv`  
- Model evaluation: R², R²_adj  
- Plotting:
  - Predicted curve  
  - Raw data  
  - Optimal stagger point  
- Use of `fprintf` for reporting results  

## 📊 Outputs
The script(s) generate:
- Plots comparing model predictions vs. measured laps  
- Optimal stagger value and predicted lap time  
- Coefficient of determination (Part 2)  

## 🚗 Engineering Insight
Rear stagger tuning is critical for oval performance. This project:
- Demonstrates how small changes in tire circumference affect corner entry, rotation, and straight-line stability  
- Builds a data-driven method for choosing qualifying setup  
- Includes a recommendation email to the crew chief
