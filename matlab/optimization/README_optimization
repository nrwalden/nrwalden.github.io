# Aerodynamic Wing Optimization – GT3 Rear Wing Configuration

This project uses nonlinear optimization to identify the ideal rear-wing fore-aft position (x) and height (z) for a GT3 car at Road America. The objective is to minimize lap time while satisfying straight-line cooling/load constraints.

## 🏁 Scenario
As the GT3 engineering intern, you must deliver an optimal wing configuration before qualifying. The model uses nonlinear relationships between:
- Lift coefficient (CL)
- Drag coefficient (CD)
- Downforce saturation benefit
- Drag penalty
- Straight-line cooling load constraint

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement aerodynamic coefficient models for CL(x,z) and CD(x,z)
- Create a lap-time proxy function T(x,z)
- Implement a load-cap constraint LC(x,z) ≤ 0.70
- Use MATLAB’s **fmincon** to find optimal x and z
- Visualize the objective and constraints on a contour map

## 🛠️ MATLAB Techniques Demonstrated
- Nonlinear function definition
- Constrained optimization using:
  - `fmincon`
  - Bounds (`lb`, `ub`)
  - Functional constraints
- Visualization of:
  - Objective function
  - Constraint boundaries
  - Optimal configuration point

## 📊 Outputs
The script returns:
- Optimal fore-aft position (mm)
- Optimal wing height (mm)
- Predicted minimum lap time
- Contour plot showing the feasible region vs. objective landscape

## 🚗 Engineering Insight
This project mimics GT and prototype aerodynamic workflow:
- Tradeoff between straight-line cooling vs. cornering downforce
- Sensitivity of performance to millimeter-scale wing adjustments
- Visualizing race-engineering decision spaces
