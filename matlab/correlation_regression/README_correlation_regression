# Multivariable Correlation & Regression – St. Petersburg Indy NXT Analysis

This project analyzes practice telemetry from a St. Petersburg–style street circuit to identify which setup and environmental variables most strongly influence lap time. The goal is to build a predictive regression model to support setup decisions prior to the 2026 Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.

## 📈 Objectives
- Import, clean, and prepare telemetry data from `stpete_practice.csv`
- Generate a **correlation matrix** and **scatterplot matrix** to visualize relationships  
- Build a **multivariable regression model** for lap time using:
  - Track temperature  
  - Fuel load  
  - Tire age  
- Evaluate nonlinear effects through quadratic terms  
- Generate surface + contour plots to visualize influences on lap time  
- Identify the combination of (track_temp, tire_age) that produces the minimum lap time

## 🛠️ MATLAB Techniques Demonstrated
- `readtable`, `table2array`  
- `corrcoef`, `heatmap`, `plotmatrix`  
- `fitlm` for multivariable regression  
- Surface & contour plotting with `surf`, `contour`  
- Extracting optimal conditions using `min`  

## 📊 Outputs
The script produces:
- Correlation heatmap  
- Scatter matrix  
- Regression output table  
- Surface plot of predicted lap time  
- Contour plot highlighting the minimum lap time point  

## 🚗 Engineering Insight
This project simulates real motorsports data analysis by:
- Separating causal vs. non-causal variables (e.g., excluding avg_speed to avoid circular reasoning)
- Analyzing setup sensitivity before race weekend
- Delivering actionable recommendations to a crew chief

A written recommendation email summarizing results is also included.
