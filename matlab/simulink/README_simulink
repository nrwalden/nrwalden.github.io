# Semi-Active Suspension Modeling & Control – Simulink Quarter-Car

This project builds and compares passive vs. semi-active suspension systems using a quarter-car Simulink model. A PID-controlled variable damper is used to improve ride quality and stability over road disturbances.

## 🏎️ Scenario
You are tasked with designing a semi-active suspension controller similar to MagneRide. The model uses:
- Sprung mass = 250 kg  
- Spring constant = 18,000 N/m  
- Variable damping range = 800–1500 N·s/m  

## 📘 Project Tasks

### **Task 1 — Build Plant Model**
- Implement the quarter-car differential equation  
- Road input = sine wave  
- Constant damping coefficient  
- Output displacement x(t)  
- Run simulation for 10 seconds  

### **Task 2 — PID Controller Integration**
- Add variable damping:  
  **c(t) = c_min + u(t)(c_max − c_min)**  
- Implement PID with saturation + anti-windup  
- Compare controlled vs. uncontrolled suspension behavior  

### **Task 3 — Impulse Input Response**
- Replace sine wave with impulse  
- Output both displacement x(t) and acceleration d²x/dt²  
- Compare performance with/without controller  

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Simulink modeling (integrators, subsystems, scopes)  
- PID tuning with saturation limits  
- Modeling dynamic systems from differential equations  
- Comparison of passive vs. controlled systems  

## 📊 Outputs
- Time-domain displacement and acceleration plots  
- Demonstration of improved damping control  
- Simulink files:
  - `*_task1.slx`
  - `*_task2.slx`
  - `*_task3.slx`
  - `const.m` (parameter definitions)

## 🚗 Engineering Insight
This project mimics real suspension control development:
- Shows how variable damping impacts comfort + stability  
- Demonstrates ECU-style control signals  
- Highlights tradeoffs between responsiveness and overshoot
