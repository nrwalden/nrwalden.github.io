Coach,

Regression analysis shows that fuel load has the largest effect on lap 
time, followed by tire age, with track temperature playing a smaller role. 
The model (R² ≈ 0.53) predicts a minimum lap time of ≈ 62.9 s occurring 
around 29 °C track temp, fresh tires, and average fuel load.

Recommendation: Plan qualifying runs early in the session on new tires with 
a mid-range fuel load. Avoid heat buildup and extended tire age to maintain 
pace consistency.

Notes: Results come from practice-lap data only and exclude average speed 
to prevent circularity. While the fit is moderate, the trends clearly show 
the impact of tire wear and fuel mass on lap time.
